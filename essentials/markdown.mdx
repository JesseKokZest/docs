## Big words (Titles)

Use big words to start a new part of your page!

```md
## Big words
```

### Smaller words (Subtitles)

Use smaller words under the big words!

```md
### Smaller words
```

<Tip>

Big words and smaller words show up in a list on the side of the page. Cool!

</Tip>

## Making words look different

You can make your words look fun! Just put special marks around them.

| What it does  | What you type     | What you see    |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Fat letters   | `**fat**`         | **fat**         |
| Slanty letters| `_slanty_`        | _slanty_        |
| Crossed out   | `~oops~`          | ~oops~          |

You can mix them too! Type `**_fat and slanty_**` to get **_fat and slanty_** words!

Want tiny letters? Use these special words:

| What it does    | What you type            | What you see           |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Tiny up high    | `<sup>tiny up</sup>`     | <sup>tiny up</sup>     |
| Tiny down low   | `<sub>tiny down</sub>`   | <sub>tiny down</sub>   |

## Clicking to go places (Links)

You can make words that take you somewhere when you click them!

Type `[click me](https://google.com)` to make [click me](https://google.com).

The words in `[]` are what people see. The words in `()` are where they go!

## Fancy quotes (Blockquotes)

### One line

Put a `>` before your words to make them look special!

> Once upon a time, there was a little duck.

```md
> Once upon a time, there was a little duck.
```

### Many lines

> Once upon a time, there was a little duck.
>
> The duck liked to swim and play all day!

```md
> Once upon a time, there was a little duck.
>
> The duck liked to swim and play all day!
```

### Math stuff (LaTeX)

For when you learn big kid math!

<Latex>1 + 1 = 2</Latex>

```md
<Latex>1 + 1 = 2</Latex>
```
